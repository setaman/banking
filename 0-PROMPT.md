# Vibe Coding Experiment

I want to conduct a practical vibe coding experiment that simulates a software engineering agency working with a fictional customer project.

I need your assistance in creating a kick-off prompt to initialize an autonomous project execution powered by a swarm of AI agents.

## Customer Request

I use DKB (Deutsche Kredit Bank) for one of my bank accounts, as well as other providers such as Deutsche Bank.

These banks provide only limited analytical insights into personal finances. They lack advanced insights and personalized financial analytics.

I want to develop a web-based dashboard that allows users to track their bank accounts, gain advanced insights, and receive personalized financial analytics.

I have no experience in software development, so I need a team of experts to help me build this application.

**High-level functional requirements:**

* Web-based application, intended primarily for personal use
* Primary focus on DKB and Deutsche Bank, with support for additional providers
* Support for multiple bank accounts
* A dashboard providing metrics and insights on spending habits, income versus expenses, savings goals, and more, including:

  * Transactions overview
  * Date-range filtering
  * Total balance overview
  * Balance history chart
  * Spending categorization (e.g., groceries, entertainment, bills)
  * Income versus expenses analysis
  * Average monthly spending and income
  * Additional useful insights where appropriate

**High-level non-functional requirements:**

* Secure handling of sensitive financial data
* Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices
* Scalable architecture to support future growth and additional features
* User-friendly interface with intuitive navigation
* Aesthetically pleasing, modern design
* Simplicity: no server, database, or cloud infrastructure; local usage only
* Data access must not require entering passwords or sensitive credentials; read-only access is sufficient

  * Configuration may be provided manually via the local file system

For further details, please ask.

## Agentic Framework

We will use a swarm of specialized AI agents as our software engineering team.

The agents will collaborate autonomously to organize, plan, design, implement, test, and deliver the project based on the customer request above.

* The agents simulate a professional software engineering agency
* Each agent has a specific role and area of expertise (e.g., project manager, software architect, front-end developer, back-end developer, QA engineer, UX designer, security expert)
* The agents communicate, delegate tasks, and coordinate efforts to ensure successful project delivery
* The agents self-organize, create a project plan, and execute it step by step
* Budget constraints apply: AI token usage is limited and must be considered during planning and execution

  * Work should proceed in small, incremental steps with frequent reviews and adjustments, rather than a single large execution
* Human involvement is limited to initiating individual steps if required; otherwise, the agents operate fully autonomously
* GitHub is used as the version control system and collaboration platform

  * The agents manage branching strategy, commit messages, pull requests, issues, and project boards accordingly
* The agents clean up existing code and artifacts that are not required (excluding agent configuration files such as `.opencode`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.)
* The agents decide autonomously on the technology stack
* The agents may communicate with the customer (me) to clarify requirements, ask questions, and gather feedback
* The agents provide regular status updates and progress reports
* Project state must be tracked so execution can be paused and resumed without loss of context
* The agents document the code and provide a user manual for the delivered application

Using the provided information, please create a kick-off prompt to initialize the autonomous project execution by the swarm of AI agents.
