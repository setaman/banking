## Content Atomization

### Breaking Down Pillar Content

**Pillar Content** (2000+ word blog post or 30+ min video):

**Can become**:

- 5-7 short-form videos (TikTok/Reels)
- 3-5 email newsletters (sections)
- 1 infographic (visual summary)
- 1 podcast episode (audio discussion)
- 1 carousel post (step-by-step)
- 1 Twitter/X thread (breakdown)
- 5-10 quote graphics (pull quotes)

---

### Atomization Process

1. **Identify key points**

3. **Adapt for each platform**
   - Format appropriately
   - Adjust length
   - Optimize for platform

4. **Link back to original**
