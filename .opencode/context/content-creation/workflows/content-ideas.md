- "What worked in [context A] that could work in [context B]?"

**M - Modify**: What can you change?

- "How can we present this differently?"

**P - Put to other uses**: What else could this be?
- "Who else could benefit from this?"

### Mind Mapping

**Process**:
1. Write main topic in center
2. Branch out with related subtopics
3. Branch further with specific ideas
4. Look for connections between branches
5. Identify content opportunities

**Example**:
```
                    [Content Creation]
                           |
        +------------------+------------------+
        |                  |                  |
    [Writing]          [Video]           [Social]
        |                  |                  |
    +---+---+          +---+---+          +---+---+
    |       |          |       |          |       |
