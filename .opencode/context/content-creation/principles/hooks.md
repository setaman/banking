# Writing Compelling Hooks

Techniques for creating attention-grabbing openings that make people want to keep reading, watching, or listening.

---

## Why Hooks Matter

**First 3 seconds are critical**:
- 80% of people decide to continue or leave within 3 seconds
- Hooks determine whether your content gets consumed or ignored
- Strong hooks increase engagement, shares, and conversions

---

## Hook Types

### 1. Question Hook
Ask a question that resonates with your audience's pain points or desires.

**Examples**:
- "Ever wonder why some content goes viral while yours gets ignored?"
- "What if I told you there's a better way to write hooks?"
- "Are you making these 3 fatal mistakes in your content?"

**Best for**: Blog posts, emails, social media

---

### 2. Statistic Hook
Lead with a surprising or compelling statistic.

**Examples**:
- "95% of content gets zero engagement. Here's why."
- "The average person scrolls past 300 posts per day. Here's how to stop them."
- "I analyzed 10,000 viral posts. Here's what they all had in common."

**Best for**: Data-driven content, credibility building

---

### 3. Story Hook
Start with a relatable story or scenario.

**Examples**:
- "I spent 6 months creating content that nobody read. Then I changed one thing..."
- "Picture this: You hit publish on your best work yet. Crickets."
- "Three years ago, I was exactly where you are now..."

**Best for**: Personal content, case studies, testimonials

---

### 4. Bold Claim Hook
Make a provocative or counterintuitive statement.

**Examples**:
- "Everything you know about content marketing is wrong."
- "You don't need more content. You need better hooks."
- "The secret to viral content has nothing to do with quality."

**Best for**: Thought leadership, contrarian takes, attention-grabbing

---

### 5. Problem-Agitation Hook
Identify a problem and agitate it before offering a solution.

**Examples**:
- "Your content is invisible. Not because it's bad, but because nobody sees it."
- "You're working twice as hard and getting half the results. Sound familiar?"
- "Every day you wait, your competitors are stealing your audience."

**Best for**: Sales copy, problem-solution content

---

### 6. Curiosity Gap Hook
Create intrigue by hinting at valuable information without revealing it.

**Examples**:
- "The one thing nobody tells you about content creation..."
- "I discovered something that changed everything. Here's what happened."
- "There's a hidden pattern in all viral content. Once you see it, you can't unsee it."

**Best for**: Clickable content, social media, email subject lines

## First Sentence Formulas

### Formula 1: Problem + Promise
"[Problem] is killing your results. Here's how to fix it."

### Formula 2: Surprising Fact + Explanation
"[Surprising fact]. Here's why it matters."

### Formula 3: Personal Story + Lesson
"I [did something]. Here's what I learned."

### Formula 4: Question + Answer Preview
"[Question]? The answer might surprise you."

### Formula 5: Bold Statement + Proof
"[Bold claim]. Here's the data to prove it."

---

## Opening Patterns by Format

### Blog Posts
- Start with a question or statistic
- Use 1-2 sentence paragraphs for easy scanning
- Promise value in the first 50 words

### Videos
- Visual hook in first 3 seconds (movement, text, face)
- Verbal hook in first 5 seconds
- Pattern interrupt (unexpected sound, visual, statement)

### Social Media Posts
- Hook in first line (before "see more")
- Use line breaks to create curiosity
- Emoji or formatting to stand out

### Emails
- Subject line = hook
- First sentence reinforces the hook
- Preview text extends the curiosity

### Podcasts
- Tease the most valuable insight upfront
- Use a story or surprising fact
- Promise a clear takeaway

---

## Attention Retention Techniques

### Open Loops
Create questions or promises early that you answer later.

**Example**: "I'll share the exact framework at the end, but first..."

### Pattern Interrupts
Break expected patterns to recapture attention.

**Examples**:
- Sudden format change
- Unexpected question
- Contrarian statement
- Personal aside

### Value Stacking
Continuously promise and deliver value throughout.

**Example**: "Not only will you learn X, but I'll also show you Y and Z."

### Micro-Commitments
Get small agreements that lead to continued engagement.

**Example**: "If you've ever felt this way, keep reading..."

## Hook Testing Checklist

Before publishing, ask:

- [ ] Does it grab attention in the first 3 seconds?
- [ ] Does it create curiosity or promise value?
- [ ] Is it relevant to my target audience?
- [ ] Does it align with the content that follows?
- [ ] Would I stop scrolling for this?
- [ ] Is it specific rather than generic?
- [ ] Does it trigger an emotional response?

---

## Common Hook Mistakes

### ❌ Too Generic
"In this post, I'll talk about content creation."

### ✅ Specific and Compelling
"The 3-second rule that determines if your content lives or dies."

---

### ❌ Burying the Lead
Starting with background info instead of the hook.

### ✅ Lead with Value
Put the most compelling information first.

---

### ❌ Overpromising
Making claims you can't deliver on.

### ✅ Honest Value
Promise what you can actually deliver.

---

## Hook Templates

### For How-To Content
- "How to [achieve desired outcome] without [common obstacle]"
- "The [number]-step process to [desired result]"
- "[Desired outcome] in [timeframe]: Here's how"

### For List Content
- "[Number] [things] that [result]"
- "I tried [number] [things]. Here's what worked."
- "The only [number] [things] you need to [result]"

### For Case Studies
- "How I [achieved result] in [timeframe]"
- "From [starting point] to [end point]: The full story"
- "[Result] without [expected requirement]: Here's how"

### For Opinion/Thought Leadership
- "Why [common belief] is wrong"
- "The truth about [topic] nobody talks about"
- "[Controversial take] and why it matters"

## Usage

Apply these hook techniques to:
