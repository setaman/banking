updates, automated reminders, and visual timelines."

questions via email."

business while customers get instant answers 24/7."

emails, you're reviewing last week's wins with your team."
```

**Promise**: Make a clear promise
```
"We'll help you reclaim 10 hours per week by automating 
your busywork."

- Effortless, Simple, Easy, Quick, Instant

### 2. Sensory Language

Instead of: "Good coffee"
Write: "Rich, aromatic coffee with notes of dark chocolate"

Instead of: "Fast software"
Write: "Lightning-fast software that responds instantly"
```

### 3. Specificity

**Be concrete, not vague**:
```
Vague: "Save money"
Specific: "Save $1,247 per year"

Vague: "Many customers"
Specific: "12,847 customers in 47 countries"
```

### 4. Active Voice

**Use active, not passive**:
```
Passive: "Your data is protected by encryption"
Active: "We encrypt your data with military-grade security"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Know your audience** - Write for one specific person
2. **Focus on benefits, not features** - What's in it for them?
3. **Use simple language** - Write at 8th-grade reading level
4. **Create urgency** - Give readers a reason to act now
5. **Tell stories** - Stories are memorable and persuasive
6. **Use social proof** - Testimonials, case studies, numbers
7. **Remove friction** - Make it easy to take action
8. **Test everything** - A/B test headlines, CTAs, copy
9. **Edit ruthlessly** - Cut unnecessary words
10. **Read it aloud** - Does it sound natural?

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ **Jargon and buzzwords** - Confuses readers
- ❌ **Passive voice** - Weakens your message
- ❌ **Vague claims** - "Best in class" without proof
- ❌ **Too many CTAs** - Confuses and dilutes action
- ❌ **Focusing on features** - Readers care about benefits
- ❌ **Long paragraphs** - Hard to scan and read
- ❌ **No clear value proposition** - Why should they care?
- ❌ **Ignoring objections** - Address concerns proactively

## Copy Checklist

Before publishing, ask:
- [ ] Does the headline grab attention?
- [ ] Is the value proposition clear in 5 seconds?
- [ ] Are benefits emphasized over features?
- [ ] Is there social proof or credibility?
- [ ] Is there a clear, compelling CTA?
- [ ] Have I addressed objections?
- [ ] Is the copy scannable (headers, bullets, short paragraphs)?
- [ ] Does it pass the "so what?" test?
- [ ] Is it free of jargon and complex language?
- [ ] Have I created urgency or scarcity?
