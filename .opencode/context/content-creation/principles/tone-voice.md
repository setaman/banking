```

### 4. Be Inclusive

**Exclusive**:

```

**Inclusive**:
```
"Check out our new feature!"
```

### 5. Avoid Jargon

**Jargon-heavy**:
```
"Leverage our API to synergize your tech stack."
```

**Clear**:
```
"Connect our API to your existing tools."
```

## Emotional Tone Mapping

### User Emotional State → Appropriate Tone

```
"I know this is frustrating. Let's fix this together."
```

**User achieved something** → Celebratory, encouraging
```
"Awesome work! You've completed your first project."
```

**User is confused** → Patient, educational
```
"No worries! Let me break this down for you."
```

**User made an error** → Helpful, non-judgmental
```
"Looks like there's a small issue. Here's how to fix it."
```

**User is new** → Welcoming, supportive
```
"Welcome! We're here to help you get started."
```

## Best Practices

1. **Create a voice chart** - Document your brand's voice attributes
2. **Use real examples** - Show, don't just tell
3. **Consider context** - Adapt tone to situation
4. **Be consistent** - Use the same voice across channels
5. **Avoid clichés** - "Think outside the box," "game-changer"
6. **Use contractions** - "We're" not "We are" (unless formal)
7. **Address the user** - Use "you" and "your"
8. **Be specific** - Concrete details over vague statements
9. **Test with users** - Does it resonate?
10. **Update regularly** - Voice evolves with your brand
