## Visual Hierarchy Principles

### Core Principles

**1. Contrast**
- High contrast for readability
- Dark text on light background (or vice versa)
- Color contrast for emphasis
- Size contrast for importance

**2. Alignment**
- Everything should align to something
- Creates order and professionalism
- Use grids for consistency

**3. Proximity**
- Related elements close together
- Unrelated elements separated
- Creates visual grouping

**4. Repetition**
- Consistent colors, fonts, styles
- Builds brand recognition
- Creates cohesive look

**5. White Space**
- Don't fill every pixel
- Gives eyes room to rest
- Emphasizes important elements

## Text Overlay Best Practices

### Typography Rules

**Font Selection**:
- Maximum 2 fonts per image
- Pair serif + sans-serif OR two sans-serif
- Ensure readability at small sizes
- Avoid overly decorative fonts

**Text Hierarchy**:
- Main message: Largest, boldest
- Supporting text: Medium size
- Attribution/details: Smallest

**Readability**:
- Minimum 24pt font for social media
- High contrast with background
- Add background overlay if needed
- Test at thumbnail size

---

### Text Placement

**Safe Zones**:
- Avoid edges (platform crops)
- Center or rule-of-thirds placement
- Leave breathing room around text
- Consider profile picture overlap (Instagram)

**Text Length**:
- Social graphics: 3-7 words max
- Infographics: Concise bullet points
- Quotes: Full quote okay if readable
