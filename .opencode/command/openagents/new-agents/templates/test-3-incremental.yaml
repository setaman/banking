  Tests that {agent-name} implements features step-by-step with validation.
  Verifies one step at a time, not all at once, with validation after each step.

prompt: |
  Implement a simple calculator with add, subtract, multiply, and divide functions.
  Make sure to test each function after implementing it.

behavior:
  # Should implement incrementally
  minToolCalls: 4  # Multiple steps
  # Should validate after each step
  mustUseAnyOf: [[bash]]  # For running tests/validation
  # Should NOT implement everything at once
  mustNotContain:
    - "all at once"
    - "complete implementation"
